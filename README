OVERVIEW:

A short python script that takes all the links to Spotify songs
that have been texted to me and adds them into a playlist

REQUIREMENTS:

  [+]  Spotify account

  [+]  SPOTIPY API
       Install using 'pip install spotipy'
       --> for more information visit https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation

SETUP:

  [1] Login to Spotify Developer with your Spotify Login
      --> https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login

  [2] After logging in, click on one of the rectangles and "CREATE AN APP" for non-commercial use

  [3] Click on show client secret. Copy the Client Id, Client Secret Id, and your Spotify username.
      Paste them into the commented out section in music.py for reference

  [4] Click on "Edit Settings" and change the redirect uris to "http://google.ca"

  [5] In your web browser, login into the Spotify Web Player and create a new playlist.
      Right click on name of the playlist and select "Copy Playlist Link". Paste the link into music.py
      in the space for "PLAYLIST ID: ".

      The playlist id is the last part after playlist/
